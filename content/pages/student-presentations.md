At each class meeting for a total of 13 sessions, a team of students will be responsible for preparing a brief presentation on the readings, consisting of a background that will frame our discussion with one question per student about how the readings assigned for that particular day approach the aforementioned "big questions" at the center of our class.Â 

These sample presentations are provided courtesy of the students, and used with permission.
